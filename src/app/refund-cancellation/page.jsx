					DHEERU RAJPOOT believes in helping its customers as far as
					possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy.
					Under this policy:
				</p>
				<p>
					Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
					immediately after placing the order. However, the
					cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders
					have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they
					have initiated the process of shipping them.
				</p>

				<p>
					DHEERU RAJPOOT does not accept cancellation requests for
					perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However,
					refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes
					that the quality of product delivered is not good.
				</p>
				<p>
					Refund/replacement can be made only if the product is
					returned to us in the original packaging, with all the
					original accessories and documents.
				</p>
				<p>
					In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please
					report the same to our Customer Service team. The request
					will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked
					and determined the same at his own end. This should be
					reported within Only same day days of receipt of the
					products. In case you feel that the product received is not
					as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must
					bring it to the notice of our customer service within Only
					same day days of receiving the product. The Customer Service
					Team after looking into your complaint will take an
					appropriate decision.
				</p>

				<p>
					In case of complaints regarding products that come with a
					warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
					In case of any Refunds approved by the DHEERU RAJPOOT, itâ€™ll
					take 3-5 Days days for the refund to be processed to the end
					customer.
